PROJECT OVERVIEW: findings from the Datasets:

1. Average Income and Bike Purchase by Gender:
From the data, I observed that males generally have higher average incomes compared to females, regardless of whether they purchased a bike or not. Interestingly, individuals who purchased a bike also tend to have higher average incomes across both genders. Overall, the average income among bike purchasers ($57,962.58) exceeds that of non-purchasers ($54,874.76).

2. Count of Bike Purchases by Commute Distance:
Looking at commute distances, it's clear that individuals with shorter commutes, particularly between 0-1 miles, are more likely to purchase a bike. As commute distance increases, the likelihood of purchasing a bike generally decreases. Notably, there's a sharp decline in bike purchases for distances greater than 10 miles, suggesting practicality plays a significant role in bike purchasing decisions.

3. Count of Bike Purchases by Age Brackets:
When analyzing bike purchases by age, middle-aged individuals stand out as the group most likely to purchase a bike. They account for the highest number of bike purchases compared to adolescents and older adults. In contrast, adolescents show the lowest bike purchase rate, possibly due to factors like limited income or preference for other modes of transport.


General Observations:
Income Influence: Higher income levels correlate with a greater likelihood of bike purchase, which aligns with the higher average incomes seen among bike purchasers.
Gender Differences: Males not only have higher average incomes but are also more inclined to purchase bikes compared to females.
Commute Distance: Shorter commutes, especially those within 0-1 miles, see more bike purchases, likely due to the convenience and feasibility of biking for short distances. Conversely, longer commutes above 10 miles show a significant drop in bike purchases, possibly due to practical considerations.
Age Influence: Middle-aged individuals show the highest propensity for purchasing bikes, suggesting they might prioritize biking for leisure or health reasons compared to younger or older age groups.

These findings underscore the complex interplay between income, gender, commute patterns, and age in influencing bike purchasing behaviors.
